# Enhancing Distributed Low-Cost Object Storage with Near Storage Computation

This repository contains all code used and discussed in my Bachelor Thesis at the Technical University Munich.
The folders are structured after the individual chapters.
The utils folder contains code used for server setup and benchmarking.

I want to thank M.Sc. Maximilian Kuschewski https://maxi.fyi/ for making this work possible.
